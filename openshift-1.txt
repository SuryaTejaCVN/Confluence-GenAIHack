## Advanced OpenShift Developer Handbook

### 1. **Troubleshooting Common Issues in OpenShift**

OpenShift provides a powerful platform for managing containerized applications, but troubleshooting issues effectively requires an understanding of the key components and tools available for diagnosis. Here are some common problems and their resolutions:

#### 1.1 **Pods Fail to Start**
   - **Common Causes**:
     - Insufficient resources (CPU, memory) available.
     - Image pull errors (e.g., incorrect image name, private registry issues).
     - Missing or misconfigured environment variables.
   - **Resolution**:
     - **Check pod status**:
       ```bash
       oc get pods -o wide
       ```
     - **Check pod events** for detailed errors:
       ```bash
       oc describe pod <pod-name>
       ```
     - **Check logs** of the pod for errors:
       ```bash
       oc logs <pod-name> --previous
       ```
     - **Check resource requests and limits**:
       Ensure that resource requests/limits are configured correctly in the Deployment/Pod spec.

#### 1.2 **Image Pull Failures**
   - **Common Causes**:
     - Private image repository credentials missing.
     - Incorrect image tag or repository name.
   - **Resolution**:
     - **Check image stream status**:
       ```bash
       oc get is <image-stream-name> -o yaml
       ```
     - **Check registry secrets**:
       ```bash
       oc secrets list
       oc describe secret <secret-name>
       ```
     - **Force a pull by deleting the pod**:
       ```bash
       oc delete pod <pod-name>
       ```
     - **Recheck the registry credentials** in the deployment configuration.

#### 1.3 **Persistent Storage Issues**
   - **Common Causes**:
     - Volume mount issues.
     - Insufficient persistent volume claims (PVC) available.
   - **Resolution**:
     - **Check PVC status**:
       ```bash
       oc get pvc
       ```
     - **Check the persistent volume (PV) status**:
       ```bash
       oc get pv
       ```
     - **Check events related to PVC and PV**:
       ```bash
       oc describe pvc <pvc-name>
       ```
     - **Ensure the correct storage class** is used and that it has available capacity.

#### 1.4 **Networking Problems (e.g., Services Not Accessible)**
   - **Common Causes**:
     - Misconfigured services or routes.
     - Network policies blocking traffic.
     - DNS resolution issues.
   - **Resolution**:
     - **Check service endpoints**:
       ```bash
       oc get svc
       oc describe svc <service-name>
       ```
     - **Check route status**:
       ```bash
       oc get routes
       oc describe route <route-name>
       ```
     - **Check network policies**:
       ```bash
       oc get networkpolicy
       oc describe networkpolicy <policy-name>
       ```
     - **Check DNS configuration**:
       Ensure DNS service is running, and DNS records are updated.

#### 1.5 **Scaling Issues (e.g., Deployment Fails to Scale)**
   - **Common Causes**:
     - Insufficient resource availability.
     - Incorrect configuration in horizontal pod autoscaler.
   - **Resolution**:
     - **Check deployment scaling settings**:
       ```bash
       oc get deployment <deployment-name>
       ```
     - **Check Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**:
       ```bash
       oc get hpa
       oc describe hpa <hpa-name>
       ```
     - **Review resource requests/limits** and adjust accordingly to allow autoscaling.

### 2. **OpenShift Installation Setup**

Setting up OpenShift in a production or development environment can vary based on the use case and scale. OpenShift can be installed on public/private clouds, on-premises infrastructure, or even locally using **Minishift** or **CodeReady Containers (CRC)** for development purposes.

#### 2.1 **Installing OpenShift on Bare Metal or VM Infrastructure**
   - **Prerequisites**:
     - At least 3 master nodes (for HA setup) and 2 worker nodes.
     - A Linux distribution (RHEL, CentOS, or Fedora) or a VM setup.
     - OpenShift Installer and `oc` CLI tool.
   - **Step-by-Step**:
     1. **Download the OpenShift installer**:
        Go to the [OpenShift Downloads page](https://www.openshift.com/try) and download the installer for your platform.
     2. **Generate an installation configuration**:
        ```bash
        openshift-install create manifests
        openshift-install create ignition-configs
        ```
     3. **Configure the install parameters** in `install-config.yaml` (e.g., cluster name, base domain, etc.).
     4. **Run the installation**:
        ```bash
        openshift-install create cluster
        ```
     5. **Verify the installation**:
        Access the OpenShift console or use the `oc` CLI to check the status of nodes:
        ```bash
        oc get nodes
        ```

#### 2.2 **Installing OpenShift Using OKD (OpenShift Origin) for Development**
   - **Prerequisites**:
     - Virtual Machine or Cloud Infrastructure with at least 2 CPUs and 8 GB of RAM.
     - Container Runtime (Docker, Podman) installed.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Download and configure the OKD installer:
        ```bash
        wget https://github.com/openshift/okd/releases/download/<version>/openshift-install-linux-<version>.tar.gz
        ```
     2. **Install OKD on a local machine**:
        Use [CodeReady Containers (CRC)](https://www.openshift.com/products/codeready-containers) for local development:
        ```bash
        crc setup
        crc start
        ```
     3. **Access OpenShift Cluster**:
        Use the OpenShift web console (URL provided by CRC) or the `oc` CLI.

#### 2.3 **Using OpenShift on Cloud Providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)**
   - **AWS**:
     OpenShift on AWS can be installed using the OpenShift Installer. The installer automatically provisions AWS resources.
     ```bash
     openshift-install --dir=./install create cluster
     ```
   - **Azure**:
     OpenShift on Azure can be installed using the Azure OpenShift service or via the installer on a VM:
     ```bash
     openshift-install --dir=./install create cluster
     ```
   - **GCP**:
     For Google Cloud, the installation process is similar. Use the OpenShift installer to create clusters, and GCP's managed services for support.

### 3. **Deployment Strategies in OpenShift**

OpenShift provides several strategies for deploying and managing applications, each suited to different workloads and development cycles.

#### 3.1 **Rolling Deployment**
   - **Definition**: Deployments are updated gradually. New pods are created and rolled out while old pods are terminated.
   - **How to Use**:
     - Default strategy for OpenShift deployments.
     - Use `oc rollout` to manage the deployment process.
     ```bash
     oc rollout status deployment <deployment-name>
     oc rollout undo deployment <deployment-name>
     ```

#### 3.2 **Blue-Green Deployment**
   - **Definition**: Two identical environments (blue and green) are used for production. One environment serves live traffic while the other is updated.
   - **How to Use**:
     - Create two distinct routes, each for the blue and green environments.
     - After testing the green environment, switch the route to the green version.
     - Use OpenShift’s routing features and `oc expose` commands to manage blue-green traffic.
     ```bash
     oc expose svc <service-name> --name=route-blue
     ```

#### 3.3 **Canary Deployment**
   - **Definition**: A subset of users are served the new version of the application before a full rollout is done.
   - **How to Use**:
     - Define different traffic percentages for canary deployments (e.g., 90% traffic to the stable version, 10% to the new version).
     - Configure routes to split the traffic between canary and stable pods.

#### 3.4 **StatefulSet Deployment**
   - **Definition**: Used for applications that require stable, unique network identifiers, stable storage, and ordered deployment/termination.
   - **How to Use**:
     - Create a StatefulSet instead of a Deployment for stateful workloads like databases.
     - Use OpenShift templates or YAML files to define the StatefulSet configuration.
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: apps/v1
     kind: StatefulSet
     spec:
       serviceName: "my-stateful-app"
       replicas: 3
       selector:
         matchLabels:
           app: my-stateful-app
     ```

### 4. **Best Practices for Managing Applications in OpenShift**

#### 4.1 **Managing Resources (CPU and Memory)**
   - Set **resource requests** and **limits** for both CPU and memory for each container in your pod specifications to ensure efficient resource allocation and avoid over-utilization of cluster resources.
     ```yaml
     resources:
       requests:
         memory: "256Mi"
         cpu: "500m"
       limits:
         memory: "512Mi"


         cpu: "1"
     ```

#### 4.2 **Handling Secrets and ConfigMaps**
   - **Secrets** store sensitive information such as passwords, keys, etc., and can be referenced in pod specifications.
   - **ConfigMaps** store non-sensitive configuration data that can be injected into pods.
     ```bash
     oc create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=key1=value1
     oc create configmap my-config --from-file=config.txt
     ```

#### 4.3 **Scaling Applications**
   - **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)** allows OpenShift to automatically scale your applications based on resource utilization (e.g., CPU or memory).
     ```bash
     oc autoscale deployment <deployment-name> --min 1 --max 5 --cpu-percent 80
     ```

#### 4.4 **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
   - OpenShift supports integrated CI/CD pipelines using **OpenShift Pipelines** (based on Tekton).
     - Create and manage pipelines using `oc` CLI or via the OpenShift Web Console.
     - Configure triggers to automatically deploy code on commits to a repository.

#### 4.5 **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Use **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring metrics, and **Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK stack)** for logging.
     - Set up alerts and dashboards to monitor pod health and resource usage.

## Advanced OpenShift Developer Handbook

### 10. **OpenShift Networking**

Networking in OpenShift can be complex, but understanding the key components such as Services, Routes, Network Policies, and Ingress Controllers is critical for building scalable, secure applications.

#### 10.1 **Services**
   - **Definition**: A Service is an abstraction layer that defines how to access a set of Pods. It provides stable DNS names and IP addresses for accessing applications in the cluster.
   - **Types**:
     - **ClusterIP**: Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. Only reachable within the cluster.
     - **NodePort**: Exposes the service on a static port on each nodeâ€™s IP.
     - **LoadBalancer**: Creates an external load balancer that routes traffic to your service.
     - **ExternalName**: Maps a service to an external DNS name.

   - **Example**: Exposing a deployment via a Service
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Service
     metadata:
       name: myapp-service
     spec:
       selector:
         app: myapp
       ports:
         - protocol: TCP
           port: 8080
           targetPort: 8080
       type: ClusterIP
     ```

   - **Accessing Services**:
     ```bash
     oc expose deployment myapp --name=myapp-service
     ```

#### 10.2 **Routes**
   - **Definition**: OpenShift Routes allow you to expose a service outside the OpenShift cluster to the internet. Routes map an external DNS name to an internal Service.
   - **Creating Routes**:
     - **Example**: Exposing a Service via a Route
       ```bash
       oc expose svc/myapp-service --hostname=myapp.example.com
       ```
     - This command creates a route to the `myapp-service` that is accessible via `myapp.example.com`.
     
#### 10.3 **Ingress Controllers**
   - **Definition**: Ingress controllers manage external HTTP/S access to services in the OpenShift cluster, often used for handling URL routing, SSL termination, etc.
   - **Configuring an Ingress**:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
     kind: Ingress
     metadata:
       name: myapp-ingress
     spec:
       rules:
         - host: myapp.example.com
           http:
             paths:
               - path: /
                 pathType: Prefix
                 backend:
                   service:
                     name: myapp-service
                     port:
                       number: 8080
     ```

#### 10.4 **Network Policies**
   - **Definition**: Network policies are used to define the allowed traffic between Pods within a cluster. They help control access to services based on labels.
   - **Example**: Restricting communication between Pods:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
     kind: NetworkPolicy
     metadata:
       name: deny-all-ingress
     spec:
       podSelector: {}
       policyTypes:
       - Ingress
     ```

### 11. **OpenShift Security**

Security is a top priority in OpenShift. By leveraging **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, **Security Contexts**, **Network Policies**, **Service Accounts**, and **Pod Security Policies**, you can secure your cluster, applications, and workloads effectively.

#### 11.1 **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**
   - **Definition**: RBAC allows you to define what actions a user or a service account can perform on different OpenShift resources.
   - **Example**: Creating a Role and RoleBinding
     - **Role**:
       ```yaml
       kind: Role
       apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
       metadata:
         namespace: mynamespace
         name: admin-role
       rules:
         - apiGroups: [""]
           resources: ["pods"]
           verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "delete"]
       ```
     - **RoleBinding**:
       ```yaml
       kind: RoleBinding
       apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
       metadata:
         name: admin-binding
         namespace: mynamespace
       subjects:
         - kind: User
           name: "developer-user"
           apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
       roleRef:
         kind: Role
         name: admin-role
         apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
       ```

#### 11.2 **Service Accounts**
   - **Definition**: Service accounts are used by Pods to authenticate with the Kubernetes API server.
   - **Creating a Service Account**:
     ```bash
     oc create serviceaccount myapp-service-account
     ```

   - **Using Service Accounts in Deployments**:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: apps/v1
     kind: Deployment
     metadata:
       name: myapp-deployment
     spec:
       template:
         spec:
           serviceAccountName: myapp-service-account
           containers:
             - name: myapp
               image: myapp-image
     ```

#### 11.3 **Security Contexts**
   - **Definition**: A security context defines privilege and access control settings for Pods and Containers.
   - **Example**: Defining a Security Context for a Pod:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Pod
     metadata:
       name: myapp
     spec:
       securityContext:
         runAsUser: 1000
       containers:
         - name: myapp-container
           image: myapp-image
           securityContext:
             allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
     ```

### 12. **OpenShift CI/CD Pipelines**

OpenShift supports Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) through native tools like **OpenShift Pipelines** (based on **Tekton**) and integration with **Jenkins**.

#### 12.1 **OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton)**

Tekton is a Kubernetes-native CI/CD framework that integrates seamlessly with OpenShift to automate the build, test, and deployment pipelines.

   - **Installing OpenShift Pipelines**:
     ```bash
     oc apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/latest/release.yaml
     ```

   - **Creating a Pipeline**:
     A pipeline in Tekton defines a series of tasks (e.g., build, test, deploy).
     - **Example**:
       ```yaml
       apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
       kind: Pipeline
       metadata:
         name: example-pipeline
       spec:
         tasks:
           - name: build
             taskRef:
               name: build-task
           - name: deploy
             taskRef:
               name: deploy-task
       ```

   - **Creating a PipelineRun**:
     A PipelineRun triggers the pipeline to run with specific parameters.
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
     kind: PipelineRun
     metadata:
       name: example-pipelinerun
     spec:
       pipelineRef:
         name: example-pipeline
     ```

#### 12.2 **Jenkins Pipelines**
   - **Integration with Jenkins**: OpenShift allows you to create Jenkins pipelines to automate your build and deployment processes.
     - **Installing Jenkins**:
       ```bash
       oc new-app jenkins-ephemeral
       ```

   - **Creating Jenkinsfile**:
     A Jenkinsfile defines the pipeline logic (build, test, deploy).
     - **Example**:
       ```groovy
       pipeline {
         agent any
         stages {
           stage('Build') {
             steps {
               echo 'Building the application'
             }
           }
           stage('Test') {
             steps {
               echo 'Running tests'
             }
           }
           stage('Deploy') {
             steps {
               echo 'Deploying application'
             }
           }
         }
       }
       ```

   - **Triggering Builds**: Jenkins can be integrated with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to trigger builds on commit events.

### 13. **Custom Operators in OpenShift**

OpenShift allows developers to extend the platform by creating **Custom Operators**, which automate the lifecycle management of complex, stateful applications.

#### 13.1 **What is an Operator?**
   - **Definition**: Operators are Kubernetes-native applications that manage the lifecycle of other applications, providing features like installation, upgrades, and scaling.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - Managing databases, like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
     - Managing stateful applications with complex configurations.

#### 13.2 **Creating a Custom Operator**
   - **Operator SDK**: The OpenShift Operator SDK is used to build custom operators.
     - **Example**: Installing the SDK:
       ```bash
       brew install operator-sdk
       ```

   - **Create an Operator**:
     ```bash
     operator-sdk init --domain=mydomain.com --repo=github.com/myorg/myoperator
     operator-sdk create api --group=app --version=v1 --kind=MyApp
     ```

#### 13.3 **Operator Deployment**
   - **Deploying the Operator**:
     Use the OpenShift CLI to deploy and manage your operator.
     ```bash
     oc apply -f deploy/crds/myapp_v1_myapp_crd.yaml
     oc apply -f deploy/operator.yaml


     ```

### 14. **OpenShift Monitoring and Logging**

Effective monitoring and logging are critical for ensuring the health and performance of applications running in OpenShift.

#### 14.1 **Prometheus and Grafana for Monitoring**
   - OpenShift uses **Prometheus** for metrics collection and **Grafana** for visualization.
   - **Accessing the OpenShift Monitoring Dashboard**:
     ```bash
     oc expose svc/prometheus-k8s -n openshift-monitoring --port=9090
     ```

#### 14.2 **EFK Stack for Logging**
   - **EFK Stack**: Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK) are used for centralized logging.
   - **Setting up Fluentd**: Fluentd collects logs from containers and forwards them to Elasticsearch.

#### 14.3 **Alerts and Notifications**
   - Use Prometheus Alertmanager to send alerts based on predefined conditions (e.g., high CPU usage).
     - **Example**:
       ```yaml
       groups:
       - name: example
         rules:
         - alert: HighCPUUsage
           expr: sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container="myapp"}[1m])) > 0.8
           for: 1m
           labels:
             severity: critical
           annotations:
             description: "CPU usage is too high."
       ```

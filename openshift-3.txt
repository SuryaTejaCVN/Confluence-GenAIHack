### 21. **OpenShift Performance Tuning**

Optimizing resource usage and ensuring high-performance applications are essential in production environments.

#### 21.1 **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)**
   - **Definition**: Automatically scale the number of Pods in a deployment based on CPU or memory usage.
   - **Example**:
     ```bash
     oc autoscale deployment myapp --cpu-percent=80 --min=1 --max=5
     ```

#### 21.2 **Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA)**
   - **Definition**: Automatically adjust the resource requests and limits for Pods based on usage.
   - **Enable VPA**:
     ```bash
     oc apply -f vpa.yaml
     ```

### 22. **Cluster Upgrades**

OpenShift supports rolling upgrades to ensure minimal downtime when upgrading the platform or your applications.

#### 22.1 **Upgrading OpenShift Cluster**
   - **Automatic Upgrades**: You can configure OpenShift to automatically check and apply updates.
   - **Manual Upgrade**:
     ```bash
     oc adm upgrade --to=4.8.0
     ```

#### 22.2 **Upgrading Applications**
   - **Deployment Configs** and **Operators** manage the upgrade process for your applications.

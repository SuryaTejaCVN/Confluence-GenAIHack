## Advanced OpenShift Developer Handbook (Part 2)

### 23. **Advanced OpenShift Configuration**

Advanced configuration of OpenShift often involves tweaking platform settings to optimize performance, enhance security, or enable features like autoscaling or custom networking.

#### 23.1 **Configuring the OpenShift Scheduler**
   - **Scheduler**: The OpenShift Scheduler is responsible for deciding where Pods will be deployed in the cluster. Customizing scheduler configurations can help you control the scheduling behavior based on specific requirements (e.g., resource usage, node taints, or affinity rules).
   - **Custom Scheduling**: You can create custom **Scheduler Profiles** to influence the scheduling decisions.
     - **Example**: Setting an affinity rule:
       ```yaml
       apiVersion: v1
       kind: Pod
       metadata:
         name: myapp-pod
       spec:
         affinity:
           nodeAffinity:
             requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
               nodeSelectorTerms:
                 - matchExpressions:
                     - key: disktype
                       operator: In
                       values:
                         - ssd
       ```

#### 23.2 **Tuning OpenShift Networking (CNI)**

   - OpenShift uses **Container Network Interface (CNI)** plugins to manage networking. By default, OpenShift uses **OpenShift SDN (Software Defined Network)**, but it also supports **Calico**, **Flannel**, and other CNIs for advanced network setups.
   - **Network Policies**: You can define **Network Policies** to control traffic between Pods and services within namespaces.
     - **Example**: Limiting traffic to a specific namespace:
       ```yaml
       apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
       kind: NetworkPolicy
       metadata:
         name: allow-from-myapp
       spec:
         podSelector:
           matchLabels:
             app: myapp
         ingress:
           - from:
               - namespaceSelector:
                   matchLabels:
                     name: mynamespace
       ```

   - **Configuring Calico for Enhanced Security**: Calico offers advanced networking and network policy features, including **IPAM** (IP Address Management) and **network segmentation**.
     - **Installing Calico**:
       ```bash
       oc apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml
       ```

#### 23.3 **OpenShift Authentication & Identity Management (OIDC)**

   - OpenShift integrates with external Identity Providers (IdP) using **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**. This allows centralized authentication and identity management for your OpenShift cluster.
   - **Configuring OIDC with OpenShift**: This involves setting up the authentication strategy in OpenShift to communicate with your identity provider (such as **Keycloak**, **Okta**, or **Active Directory**).
   - **Example**: Configuring OIDC:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
     kind: OAuth
     metadata:
       name: cluster
     spec:
       identityProviders:
         - name: "Keycloak"
           mappingMethod: claim
           type: OpenID
           openID:
             clientID: "my-client-id"
             clientSecret:
               name: "my-client-secret"
             issuer: "https://keycloak.example.com/realms/myrealm"
             claims:
               id:
                 - "sub"
               email:
                 - "email"
     ```

### 24. **Troubleshooting OpenShift Cluster Issues**

Troubleshooting is essential when dealing with complex OpenShift environments. There are numerous tools and strategies that can help you diagnose and resolve issues effectively.

#### 24.1 **Investigating Pod Failures**
   - **Check Pod Logs**:
     ```bash
     oc logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>
     ```
     If the Pod is part of a deployment, you can get logs from all Pods in the deployment:
     ```bash
     oc logs -l app=<deployment-name> -n <namespace>
     ```
   - **Describe Pod for Events**: If a Pod is stuck or in a crash loop, using `describe` gives you detailed event information.
     ```bash
     oc describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
     ```
   - **Check for Resource Quotas**: If your Pod is not starting, verify that you are not hitting resource quotas.
     ```bash
     oc get quota -n <namespace>
     ```

#### 24.2 **Network Troubleshooting**
   - **Pod Connectivity**: Verify network connectivity between Pods using the `ping` or `curl` command inside the Pod:
     ```bash
     oc rsh <pod-name> -n <namespace>
     curl http://<service-name>:<port>
     ```
   - **Check Network Policies**: Ensure that no Network Policies are blocking the communication.
     ```bash
     oc get networkpolicy -n <namespace>
     ```
   - **CNI Debugging**: For advanced network issues related to the CNI plugin, check the CNI logs:
     ```bash
     journalctl -u network-manager
     ```

#### 24.3 **Troubleshooting Cluster State**
   - **Cluster State**: OpenShift provides several CLI commands to check the clusterâ€™s overall state.
     ```bash
     oc get nodes
     oc get pods --all-namespaces
     oc get events
     ```
   - **Check Operator Status**: Sometimes, Operators might not be functioning as expected.
     ```bash
     oc get csv -n openshift-operators
     ```

### 25. **OpenShift Metrics and Observability**

Effective monitoring and observability in OpenShift are key to ensuring the health and performance of your applications and clusters.

#### 25.1 **OpenShift Metrics (Prometheus & Grafana)**
   - **Prometheus**: OpenShift integrates **Prometheus** to gather metrics for monitoring. By default, Prometheus is deployed as part of the OpenShift Monitoring Stack.
   - **Configuring Prometheus Alerts**:
     - Define alerting rules to notify you of performance issues or misconfigurations.
     - **Example**: High CPU usage alert:
       ```yaml
       apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
       kind: PrometheusRule
       metadata:
         name: high-cpu-usage-alert
         namespace: openshift-monitoring
       spec:
         groups:
           - name: cpu-usage
             rules:
               - alert: HighCPUUsage
                 expr: sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{namespace="my-namespace"}[1m])) by (pod) > 0.5
                 for: 2m
                 labels:
                   severity: high
                 annotations:
                   summary: "Pod CPU usage is too high."
       ```

   - **Grafana Dashboards**: OpenShift provides pre-configured Grafana dashboards that you can use for visualizing metrics. You can also create custom dashboards for deeper analysis.

#### 25.2 **OpenShift Logging (ELK Stack & Fluentd)**
   - OpenShift's **logging stack** (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana - EFK) provides centralized logging for all cluster components and applications.
   - **Kibana**: You can use Kibana to query logs and create visualizations.
   - **Configuring Fluentd**:
     - Customize Fluentd to filter and forward logs to external systems.
     - **Example**: Configuring Fluentd to send logs to an external syslog server:
       ```yaml
       <match **>
         @type syslog
         host "syslog.example.com"
         port 514
         protocol tcp
       </match>
       ```

#### 25.3 **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**
   - **Integration with APM tools**: OpenShift supports integration with third-party APM tools such as **Dynatrace**, **Datadog**, and **New Relic** for monitoring the performance of applications.
   - **OpenShift APM Integration**:
     - OpenShift's Operator Hub includes operators for integrating with APM systems.
     - **Example**: Installing the Dynatrace Operator:
       ```bash
       oc create -f dynatrace-operator.yaml
       ```

### 26. **Operator Best Practices**

Custom Operators allow you to automate the lifecycle of your applications on OpenShift. Developing effective operators can enhance the functionality of your OpenShift platform.

#### 26.1 **Creating and Managing Custom Operators**

   - **Operator SDK**: The **Operator SDK** is used to create custom operators. It provides templates and tools to scaffold operators that manage complex applications.
   - **Operator Architecture**: Operators usually consist of a **controller**, which watches for changes to custom resources (CRs) and performs lifecycle actions based on those changes.

   - **Example**: Creating a custom operator:
     ```bash
     operator-sdk init --domain=mydomain.com --repo=github.com/myorg/myoperator
     operator-sdk create api --group=app --version=v1 --kind=MyApp
     ```

   - **Deploying and Managing Operators**:
     ```bash
     oc apply -f deploy/crds/myapp_v1_myapp_crd.yaml
     oc apply -f deploy/operator.yaml
     ```

#### 26.2 **Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)**

   - **OLM** allows you to install, manage, and upgrade Operators within the OpenShift cluster.
   - **Operator Subscription

**: You can subscribe to an operator for a particular channel and version.
     - **Example**: Installing an operator via OLM:
       ```bash
       oc create -f operator-subscription.yaml
       ```

### 27. **Advanced OpenShift Networking and Load Balancing**

   - OpenShift provides native load balancing, but you can integrate advanced features like **Istio** for microservices communication or set up custom ingress controllers for more flexibility.

#### 27.1 **Custom Ingress Controllers**
   - OpenShift comes with an internal **HAProxy-based ingress controller** but you can configure your own custom ingress controllers for specific use cases.
   - **Example**: Deploying a custom ingress controller:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: apps/v1
     kind: Deployment
     metadata:
       name: my-ingress-controller
     spec:
       replicas: 1
       selector:
         matchLabels:
           app: ingress
       template:
         metadata:
           labels:
             app: ingress
         spec:
           containers:
             - name: ingress
               image: my-ingress-image
     ```

#### 27.2 **Istio as a Service Mesh**
   - **Istio** offers advanced routing, monitoring, and security features for managing microservice communication.
   - **Istio Gateway Configuration**:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
     kind: Gateway
     metadata:
       name: myapp-gateway
     spec:
       selector:
         istio: ingressgateway
       servers:
         - port:
             number: 80
             name: http
             protocol: HTTP
           hosts:
             - "myapp.example.com"
     ```
